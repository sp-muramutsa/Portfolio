                <h1 class="mb-4">‘Football’, and it’s all-American!</h1>
                <p>One of my fondest cultural immersion experiences is my first time ever attending an American football game. As a freshman international student at McNeese State University, I was eager to learn more about American culture. Since I have always taken sports to be an integral part of culture, our clash with Tarleton State from Texas was a chance I wasn’t going to miss out on. I pulled up to the legendary Cowboys Stadium, which I was to learn is affectionately known as the hole( now my second most favorite stadium nickname behind the Theatre of Dreams) by the locals in my gold-yellow Cowboy Camp t-shirt.</p>

                <p>To my astonishment, the hole was a sea of gold-yellow and blue, demonstrating how pokes had turned up in numbers to support our Cowboys. Of course, the numbers of pokes were also doing numbers in terms of noise, roar, and cheer. The atmosphere was simply electrifying. When I finally found a seat in the home section of the hole, I appreciated the diversity of the home fans I was now part of. The home crowd was a rainbow of ages, races, and people from all walks of life. I knew I was witnessing McNeese and sports bringing the local community together, something that made me feel at home in a land that had felt strange the minute before.</p>

                <p>After a few minutes, it was time for the avant-match and I couldn’t help but think about everything I’ve seen about high school and college football in American movies and wonder how it actually looks, sounds, and feels live. The cheerleaders were the first on display, and our eyes were blessed by their wonderfully choreographed moves on the trademark American hip-hop beats. What amazed me was how well their choreographies were coordinated (no one missed a step!) and how there were multiple groups of cheerleaders, each group so unique yet so entertaining. Second on stage was the “Pride of McNeese” marching band, who played 1960s tunes for us, the audience. During their set, a cowboy charged his horse through the field, doing a couple of tricks in the heart of it. This unique cultural aspect made me finally recognize where I had found myself and who I was going to be. This was the South; this was Louisiana; this was McNeese; these were the Cowboys.</p>

                <p>By kick-off time, I was already dying of anticipation for the main action. Our Cowboys kicked off, and the game went into full swing. I kept my eyes on the game and my ears on the friends who were explaining the rules of this relatively new game. It is hard to form an opinion of the game this early, but I noted a few things. The concept of touchdowns deeply fascinates me, as it implies gaining huge satisfaction after an energetic and collective sprint towards the end zone. Additionally, the sheer physical aspect of the sport is a sensation for the viewer and will make even the biggest rugby fan shout in awe. However, I must admit, there is more to learn about the tactical perspective before I can make any comparisons with other sports I am familiar with.</p>

                <p>On the lecto, I have to talk about a couple of other unique things I noticed. Firstly, I noticed that cannons were fired and cowbells rang after each of our field goals. This made me appreciate the poke traditions and creativity employed to create a live stadium atmosphere (even though the cannons sounded like real bombs and gave me PTSD!). Additionally, the sight of army fighter jets maneuvering over the stadium before the game and during halftime added an extra layer of grandeur to the game and gave it a unique American character of invincibility and prowess.</p>

                <p>Despite our team's 52- 34 loss, the game marked a fantastic start to the academic year, one filled with hope and optimism. As I reflect on the experience now, I can say that it left a lasting impression on me and gave me a valuable insight into American, Southern, Lousianan, and McNeese culture. All cultural elements, traditions, and observations I discussed are firsthand advocates of how the game is a true sporting sensation, which has the power to bring together people from all walks of life for moments of joy and unity in a very uniquely American fashion. Now I understand why Americans refer to it as just “football” and not “American football” as we foreigners do, ignoring the irony that feet barely come in contact with the ball during the game. The game itself is purely and uniquely American, to the extent that adding the adjective would serve no descriptive purpose. To me, football is not American; it is all-American.</p>
